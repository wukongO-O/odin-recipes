  <h3>Description</h3>
  The prodigal boy chef, Liu Mao Xing, opens the show with seafood chahan. This dish fuses the umami of seafood with flavorful fried rice. It's super simple yet yummy (and a great way to get rid of leftover rice)!

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 oz shrimps (6 shrimp; shelled and deveined)</li>
      <li>1 leaf iceberg lettuce (1 oz, 30 g)</li>
      <li>1 green onion/scallion</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, rice bran, canola, etc.)</li>
      <li>1 large egg (50 g w/o shell)</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp roasted sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 tsp sake</li>
      <li>¼ tsp kosher or sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt)</li>
      <li>2 cups cooked Japanese short-grain rice (preferably day-old cold rice)</li>
      <li>⅛ tsp white pepper powder</li>
      <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
      <li>If your shrimp is not shelled and deveined, please see How To Devein and Clean Shrimp. Cut shrimp into ½ inch (1.3 cm) pieces.</li>
      <li>Cut iceberg lettuce and scallion into small pieces.</li>
      <li>Gently whisk the egg in a small bowl.</li>
      <li>Heat wok until surface almost smoking, add the oil and spread it around till it coats the surface evenly. Add the egg and cook over high heat. The egg will not stick to the pan as long as you put enough oil. Quickly mix it with a spatula and when it’s 80% cooked, take it out and put on a plate.</li>
      <li>In the same wok, add shrimp and then sake and salt. Cook until shrimp change color outside. The inside doesn’t have to be cooked through at this time. Take shrimp out onto the plate.</li>
      <li>Add sesame oil and cook scallion, stir until nicely coated with oil.</li>
      <li>Add the rice and break up the chunks of rice. Toss the wok and mix well together.</li>
      <li>When rice is coated with oil, put the egg and shrimp back in the wok again and toss all together. Add lettuce, white pepper, freshly ground black pepper, and soy sauce. Toss the wok frequently and mix it all together. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
